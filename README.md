## Project Description

This project was developed for the Artificial Intelligence course at **UPC-FIB** and focuses on creating a **Knowledge-Based System (KBS)** using the CLIPS language. The system demonstrates rule-based reasoning, where knowledge is represented through rules and facts, and solutions are inferred using forward chaining.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the **CLIPS** environment installed. You can download and install it from the [official CLIPS website](http://www.clipsrules.net/). Ensure that the `clips` command is available in your system's terminal after installation.

## Execution Instructions

To execute the program, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root folder of the project where the `run.clp` file is located.

2. Run the following command to start CLIPS and execute the program:

   ```bash
   clips -f run.clp
   ```

3. The system will automatically load the definitions, rules, and facts, and begin executing the rules. The results will be displayed directly in the console.
